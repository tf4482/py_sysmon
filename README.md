# py_sysmon

About The Project

This System Monitoring Tool is developed as a part of a school project for students pursuing training in IT Application Development. It's designed to provide a practical approach to understanding and implementing system monitoring solutions using Python.

The application displays real-time system performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and network activity. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) developed with PyQt, and leverages the power of psutil for system monitoring and pyqtgraph for real-time data visualization. The project also explores the use of PyInstaller for creating standalone executables.

The project itself will be done in english, but the documentation will be in german, as the project is for a german school.
